# Project Telco

Learn to discern what turns the churn burn

### Project Description

Telco is a telecommunications company that offers many services to a wide range of customers. I have decided to look into the different elements of a customer churning to determine if any of them increase or decrease the chance of a customer to churn.

### Project Goal

* Discover drivers of churn of Telco customers
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify churn as a customer ending their contract or not ending (renewing) their contract with Telco
* This information could be used to further our understanding of which customer elements contribute to or detract from a customer churning.

### Initial Thoughts

My initial hypothesis is that ...

## The Plan

* Acquire data from Codeup MySQL DB

* Prepare data
   * Create Engineered columns from existing data
       * 

* Explore data in search of drivers of churn
   * Answer the following initial questions
       * How often do churn occur?
       * 

* Develop a Model to predict if a customer will churn
   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
   * Evaluate models on train and validate data
   * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
   * Evaluate the best model on test data

* Draw conclusions
